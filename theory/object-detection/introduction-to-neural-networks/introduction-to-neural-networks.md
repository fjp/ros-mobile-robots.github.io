## Introduction to Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks can learn features through supervised learning and can be categorized into three different types:

1. Classification 
2. Object detection
3. Segmentation

The underlying basis of all these neural networks is the convolutional layer.

A classification CNN takes in an input image and outputs a distribution of class scores.
