## Simulate DiffBot in Gazebo

In ROS it is common to create a package to simulate the robot in Gazebo. For DiffBot the package is named `diffbot_gazebo`.
Another example can be found in the [gazebo_ros_demos](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos) repository.

```console
fjp@ubuntu:~/git/diffbot/ros/src$ catkin create pkg diffbot_gazebo
