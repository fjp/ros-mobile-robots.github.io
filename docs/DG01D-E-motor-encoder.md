## Motor with Wheel Encoder

The [DG01D-E](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16413) is a single hobby motor with a hall speed encoder. 
This motor requires a voltage between 3-9V, has a gearbox ratio of 1:48 and a speed of 90RPM at 4.5V. 
The voltage between positive and negative is determined according to the power supply voltage of the single chip microcomputer used, 
generally 3.3V or 5V is used.

The hall sensor can sense the North and South poles of its magnetic plate. 
When the hall sensor senses the South of the magnetic plate, the hall output will result in a high level. 
Meanwhile the North is the inverse and, when sensed, the hall output will result a low level.
