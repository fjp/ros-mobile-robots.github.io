## Combining Camera and LiDAR

The main problem with a single-sensor approach is its reduced reliability as each sensor has its weaknesses under certain situations.
To improve the tracking process results we can make use of both, camera and LiDAR sensors, and can combine the data from these sensors.

The first step in the fusion process will be to combine the tracked feature points within the camera images with the 3D Lidar points. 
For this we use homogeneous coordinates and the transformation matrices related to cameras to geometrically project the LiDAR points 
into the camera in such a way that we know the position of each 3D Lidar point on the image sensor.
