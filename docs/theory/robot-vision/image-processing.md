## Image Filtering

The concept of (spacial) frequency in images is important to filter certain frequencies and thus enhance or dampen certain features of an image,
such as corners or edges.

### Frequency in Images

As with 1-D signals, frequency in images describes a rate of change in pixel intensities.

The Fourier Transform (FT) is an important image processing tool which is used to decompose an image into its frequency components. 
The output of an FT represents the image in the frequency domain, while the input image is the spatial domain (x, y) equivalent.
