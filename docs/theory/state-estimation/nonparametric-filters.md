## Non-parametric Filters Particle Filters

The goal of localization is to determin the pose(s) of a robot given a map of the environment as well as the noisy sensor measurements, 
e.g., wheel odometry and laser distance measurements. This form of state estimation can be achieved with non-parametric filters, such as particle filters.
