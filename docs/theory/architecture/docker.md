## Docker Containers

A container includes an application and its dependencies. 
It's goal is to easily ship (deploy) and handle applications.

Like real world shipping containers, Docker containers wrap up an application in a filesystem containing
everything the application needs to run:

- source code
- runtime libraries
- system tools
- configruation files

The result is that a containerzied application will run identically on any host. 
And there are no incompatibilieties of any kind.
