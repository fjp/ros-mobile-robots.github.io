### Gearbox

Gearboxes can be used to fine-tune the performance characteristics of a motion axis. 
They're most commonly considered torque multipliers but actually serve several other functions, 
including speed matching, inertia reduction, and resolution increase[ref](https://www.motioncontrolonline.org/content-detail.cfm/Motion-Control-Technical-Features/How-to-Specify-Gearboxes-for-Motion-Control-Systems/content_id/3256).
